# Introduction to Data Engineering: Building Your First Data Pipeline”

Subject of the lecture: Introduction to data pipelines
Format: Please guide us to understanding through a guided visualization on Excalidraw

## 🪄 Agenda
*aim: The teacher introduces the outline of the lecture*

Today we will go through Data Engineering introduction: "Building your first data pipeline".
For this, we will do a poll where you can write the words that comes to your mind when speaking about data engineering and data pipeline: 

-> usage of kahoot or brain storming

So here is the agenda

1. What is data engineering?
Why is that so important and what value it brings

2. How does it work? How do we build a data pipeline?
   
3. Example live with retrieving country population.

4. Conclusion
   
5. Questions

## Requirements

For this course, you need to have basic knowledge of python and coding.
Python 3.12 should be install.
It is better if you are owning a UNIX / LINUX system as it is more confortable, biut you still can with windows architecture.
However, you may need to make small changes.
You also need to speak english. (I still can do it in french but english is necessary if you want to document yourself online, most of the info is in english).
