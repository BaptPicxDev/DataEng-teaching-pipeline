# DataEng-teaching-pipeline

## Introduction

In this project, I will provide necessary information and guidelines for an introduction course to data engineering and data pipeline.
The idea is to answer "Le Wagon" teaching assessment, but for this I need a basis to allow people to follow it.
I also want to keep track about this work and I may, over the time, improve it.
Do not hesitate to fork the project and improce it on your own.

## Requirements

To follow this course, a minimum of technical skills are required.
Understanbding and basic usage of python.

We will use Python3.12.
